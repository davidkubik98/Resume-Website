          <h3>Code the Change - Website</h3>
           For this competition I contributed to a team of 4 by creating a new website for a popular club at Queenâ€™s University. Using my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript and web-design, we planned and created the website that the club was looking for. Any problems we ran into were solved using effective debugging and troubleshooting produres.
          <h3>InkScape - iOS and Android</h3>
           Inkscape is a mobile physics-based puzzle game where you guide an Octopus named Sir Inks-A-Lot through a series of obstacles using pendulum-like movement and his tentacles to connect to grabs ultimately to help him escape his tank. 
          <h3>Privacy Application - iOS </h3>
          Using biometrics such as TouchID and FaceID featured in the iPhone's, this application allows you to store files such as notes and photos while maintaining privacy. 
          <h3>Car Accident Application - iOS</h3>
           Created an iOS Application that will allow you to create a report of a car accident. I recognized the need for this type of service when a close relative was involved in a car accident but didn't know how the process worked. I hand designed a design using Apple's iOS guidelines and brought them to life using Sketch. Finally, I used the Sketch design to create the application in XCode (using Swift).
          <h3>Web Browser - MacOS</h3>
           Created a web browser exclusively for Mac's. My biggest problem with using a laptop is screen real estate. This sparked the idea of creating a web browser where the opacity can be changed and it can be made "non-clickable". This means you can place this browser over a project you're working on and watch Netflix, while still being able to see the content underneath.
          <h3>Maze Game - iOS </h3>
           Using Swift I created a maze game that utilizes your iDevice's accelerometer to move your character through complicated levels. This was also optimized to work on iPhone's &#38 iPad's.
